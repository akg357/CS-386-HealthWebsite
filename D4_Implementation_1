 ## 3. Auotmated Testing
1. **Testing Framework:*Node.js so that we can test the server side of the project* 
2. **Test Location:*tests*
3. **Test Example:*test file: tests\test_notification.js
    link to code: see index.html line 165 
    checks to make sure the text exits in the file

  1. Link to a specific test file
  2. Link to the corresponding source code being tested
  3. Brief explanation of what the test validates
4. **Test Results:** 
 ## 4. Technology Stack
 1. **Technology Name**
 2. **Description:** What it does in your system
 3. **Justification:** Why you chose it over alternatives
 ## 5. Learning Strategy
 - Learning resources used (tutorials, documentation, courses): We used some of the inforamtion from the course slides as well as using 
      outside resources such as tutorials on how to make sure the files can be used together.
 - Knowledge sharing methods within the team: We communicated our strategies and what we had changed or added and then we would have someone review 
      our code.
 - Challenges faced and how you overcame them: challanges faced were not being able to deploy some files onto oracle such as the signin nad signup pages
         We had remove them for this deployemnt and we will do it on the next one and we changed the code on the other files.
 - Time investment in learning new technologies: Time investment in learning new technologies was mostly used on oracle this was a new platform that none of 
         us had used before and we had to learn hoe to deploy our website on there.
 ## 6. Deployment
 1. **Live System Link:*https://cs-386-healthwebsite.netlify.app/* Direct URL to your deployed application
 2. **Deployment Method:*Used Netlify for deployment* Detailed description of your deployment process
 3. **Platform Justification:*free to use and integrates into github, it always displays the update main branch. Makes it easy so we dont have to update it eveytime there is merge* Why you chose your deployment platform
 1. **Live System Link:** Direct URL to your deployed application
 2. **Deployment Method:** Detailed description of your deployment process
 3. **Platform Justification:** Why you chose your deployment platform:We chose oracle as our deployment platform becasue it will allow us to implemtnt sql
    and it will allow us to use it in for the other deployments without running into problems like we had in other platforms
 ## 7. Licensing
 1. Using MIT
 2. Configure GitHub accordingly
 3. We adopted this license because it is simple, permissive, and allows others (including my professor or peers) to freely view, use, and learn from my code while giving me credit.
 
 3. Explain why you adopted this license:
 ## 8. Repository Documentation
